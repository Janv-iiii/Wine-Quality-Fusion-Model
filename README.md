# Wine-Quality-Fusion-Model
This project presents a novel machine learning framework for predicting wine quality by combining textual wine descriptions with structured features. We trained baseline and fusion models (Ridge, XGBoost) and deployed them in an interactive Gradio dashboard that visualizes predictions with score gauges and radar charts.
