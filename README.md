This project presents a novel machine learning framework for predicting wine quality by combining textual wine descriptions with structured features. We trained baseline and fusion models (Ridge, XGBoost) and deployed them in an interactive Gradio dashboard that visualizes predictions with score gauges and radar charts.



📌 Title

Wine Quality Prediction using Fusion of Text Embeddings and Machine Learning Models

📖 Overview

This project presents a novel machine learning framework for predicting wine quality by combining textual wine descriptions with structured features.
We trained baseline and fusion models (Ridge, XGBoost) and deployed them in an interactive Gradio dashboard that visualizes predictions with score gauges and radar charts.

🚀 Features

Fusion of text embeddings (Sentence-BERT) with structured data.

Baseline models for comparison.

Deployment-ready Gradio app with modern interactive UI.

Visualizations: prediction gauge + chemical profile radar chart.

🏗️ Tech Stack

Python (scikit-learn, XGBoost, joblib, numpy, pandas)

📊 Results

Fusion models outperform baselines in prediction accuracy.

Interactive Gradio dashboard improves user experience.

Visual outputs include prediction gauge and radar charts.

📌 Future Work

Expand dataset for generalization.

Add multimodal chemical features.
